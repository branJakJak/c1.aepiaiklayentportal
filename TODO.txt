@TODO
needs to be 5CXFER
its currently leads for some reason


@DONE
and Add, Dialable Leads, which you have currently as Opt IN, so change Opt IN into Diable Leads


and Add then the 5CXFER as "5 PRESS"


1 ) OptIN kanina kevs eh gawin mo syang Diable Leads
2 ) tapos yung Diable Leads is kukunin mo sya from 5CXFER
3 ) and Add then the 5CXFER as "5 PRESS"
4 ) tapos yung Opt IN eh palitan mo sya to Diable Leads

@DONE
